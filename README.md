## 🤖 Cerebras Integration


This project leverages the power of the Cerebras AI platform and Meta Llama 4 to deliver advanced natural language processing capabilities. The backend connects to a Cerebras model endpoint, which is configured to use the Meta Llama 4 large language model, to generate high-quality, context-aware responses for coding questions and tutoring sessions. By utilizing Cerebras and Meta Llama 4, Synapse AI Tutor benefits from:

- **State-of-the-art AI models** (Meta Llama 4) for code understanding and generation
- **Scalable inference** for real-time chat interactions
- **Efficient deployment** of large language models for educational use cases


### Meta Llama 4

Meta Llama 4 is a cutting-edge large language model developed by Meta, known for its strong performance in code generation, reasoning, and natural language understanding. In this project, the backend is configured to use Meta Llama 4 via the Cerebras API, ensuring that all chat responses and code explanations are generated by this advanced model. This allows Synapse AI Tutor to provide:

- Highly relevant and accurate coding assistance
- Natural, conversational interactions
- Support for a wide range of programming topics and languages

The integration is handled in the backend (see `synapse/src/backend/main.py`), where user messages are sent to the Cerebras API (with Meta Llama 4 as the underlying model), and the AI-generated responses are returned to the frontend chat interface.
